						p It seemed as if EG and Secret decided most their games in the first ten minutes of play, with the winner of the laning phase transitioning into an unstoppable late-game force.

						p Secret’s triumph means the team has won five of the six tournaments they’ve attended in 2019. Next month, Secret heads to the EPICENTER Major, the final event of this year’s Dota Pro Circuit.

Their performance in the upper bracket seemed flawless, dropping just one game during their short trip to the finals. But against Secret, the team played more stiff than flexible, relying solely on their ability to win lane and transition to late game.
