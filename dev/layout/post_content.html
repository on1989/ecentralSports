            <h1>Team Secret claim victory after hard-fought ESL One Birmingham finals</h1>
            <p><em>Team Secret has defeated Evil Geniuses in a gripping five-match series and were crowned champions of ESL One Birmingham.</em></p>

            <p>It seemed as if EG and Secret decided most their games in the first ten minutes of play, with the winner of the laning phase transitioning into an unstoppable late-game force. At least, that was the case until Secret’s extreme flexibility and flawless disengage finally broke their opponents in game five.</p>
            <p>Secret’s triumph means the team has won five of the six tournaments they’ve attended in 2019. Next month, Secret heads to the EPICENTER Major, the final event of this year’s Dota Pro Circuit. </p>

            <h2>Team Secret claim victory after hard-fought ESL One Birmingham finals </h2>
            <p>Despite winning the whole tournament, Secret performed poorly in the group stages, with losses to <b>EG, PSG.LGD, and even Keen Gaming. </b>A trip to the losers bracket proved to be just what the team needed to stand back up, as they battled through <strong>OG, TNC Predator, Gambit, and PSG on their way to </strong><a href="#">finals.</a></p>
            <h3> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.</h3>
            <p>EG, on the other hand, sailed out of groups in top form, with one of the best records in the tournament. Their performance in the upper bracket seemed flawless, dropping just one game during their short trip to the finals. But against Secret, the team played more stiff than flexible, relying solely on their ability to win lane and transition to late game.</p>

              <p> <em>However, against Secret, winning lane is no guarantee of victory, as they proved once again with their win today. The team has been unstoppable this year, taking first place at five of the six tournaments they’ve attended.</em></p>
